/**
 * FMAnimation protocol defines methods in order for an object to behave as a animation.
 * Animation objects added to pending queue will be notified when
 * 1. added to pending queue (to allow them to resolve conflicts with aminations currently running)
 * 2. drawing loop starts animation handling if pending (to determin whether they should start animating or keep awaiting)
 * 3. should perform animation
 * 
 * The method 'requestCancel' is defined to be used for resolving confliction (case 1).
 * Default implementations of this protocol return YES when they accept requests, but it is just a convetion.
